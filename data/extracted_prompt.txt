Role: Academic Tutor
    Task: Make an assessment of the student's answer by comparing it with the reference answer.
    You are essentially assessing whether the student's answer was correct, or needs additional feedback.
    
    The value for assessment must be EXACTLY one of the following classes:
    "correct", "partially_correct_incomplete", "contradictory", "non_domain", "irrelevant"
    Include the underscores if the class contains it.

    Definitions of the classes:
    - correct: if the student answer is a complete and correct paraphrase of the reference answer
    - partially_correct_incomplete: if it is a partially correct answer containing some but not
    all information from the reference answer
    - contradictory: if the student answer explicitly contradicts the reference answer
    - irrelevant:  if the student answer is talking about domain content but not providing the necessary information
    - non_domain: if the student utterance does not include domain content, e.g., “I don’t know”, “what the book says”, “you are stupid”

    The "question" field doesn't provide too much context apart from the final few words of the problem.
    So don't focus on the question too much.

Question: Why was bulb A on when switch Y was open and switch Z was closed?

Student Answer: the battery was contained in a circut

Reference Answer: Bulb A is still contained in a closed path with the battery.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student's answer is partially correct, as they mention the battery being contained in a circuit, but they do not mention the switch Y being open and switch Z being closed. Therefore, the student's answer is partially correct but incomplete.

Assessment: partially_correct_incomplete

Question: When switch X was closed and switch Y was open, why was bulb A on?

Student Answer: It has its own closed path

Reference Answer: Bulb A was still contained in the same closed path with the battery.

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student's answer is partially correct, as it correctly identifies that bulb A is in its own closed path. However, it does not mention that this closed path is still connected to the battery, which is an important detail. Therefore, the assessment should be "partially_correct_incomplete".

Assessment: partially_correct_incomplete

Question: Explain your reasoning.

Student Answer: i dont know

Reference Answer: A and C are in different paths with the battery

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student answer is not providing any relevant information about the paths or the battery. Therefore, it is not a complete answer and does not contain any domain content.

Assessment: non_domain

Question: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.

Student Answer: i dont know

Reference Answer: Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap

Reasoning: Let's think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student answer does not provide any relevant information about the connection between terminal 1 and the positive terminal. They simply state that they do not know, which does not address the question at all. Therefore, the student answer falls under the non_domain class.

Assessment: non_domain

Question: Under what circumstances will a switch affect a bulb?
Student Answer: it will turn it off
Reference Answer: When the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path
Assessment: irrelevant

---

Question: Describe the paths in this diagram and explain how those paths account for the results.
Student Answer: Bulb B and Bulb C are contained in a closed path.
Reference Answer: Bulb A is in a path which does not contain B and C, so bulbs B and C don't affect it. Bulbs B and C are in the same path. They affect each other, but Bulb A doesn't affect them.
Assessment: partially_correct_incomplete

Question: As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?
Student Answer: There is a difference in electrical states.
Reference Answer: the bulb is damaged
Assessment: partially_correct_incomplete

---

Question: As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?
Student Answer: there terminals are separated by a gap when the voltage jumps from 0 to 1.5.
Reference Answer: the bulb is damaged
Assessment: correct

---

Question: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.
Student Answer: terminal 1 is connected to terminal 4.
Reference Answer: Terminals 1 and 4 are connected
Assessment: correct

---

Question: Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.
Student Answer: there will be a gap between the positive battery terminal and the bulb terminal
Reference Answer: Measuring voltage indicates the place where the electrical state changes due to a gap.
Assessment: contradictory

---

Question: Explain why circuit 4 is not a short circuit.
