It jumps from connected to not connected.\\nReference Answer: the terminals are not connected\\nAssessment: correct\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: What does a voltage reading of 1.5 tell you about the connection between a bulb terminal and a battery terminal?\\nStudent Answer: There is a difference in eletrical states.\\nReference Answer: the terminals are not connected\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why circuit 2 is not a short circuit.\\nStudent Answer: There is a bulb connected to the battery terminal.\\nReference Answer: The battery in 2 is not in a closed path\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: What does a voltage reading of 1.5 tell you about the connection between a bulb terminal and a battery terminal?\\nStudent Answer: i do not know\\nReference Answer: the terminals are not connected\\nAssessment: non_domain\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Why do you think the other terminals are being held in a different electrical state than that of the negative terminal?\\nStudent Answer: Terminal 4, terminal 5, and terminal 6 is connected to the positive battery terminal.\\nReference Answer: Terminals 4, 5 and 6 are not connected to the negative battery terminal\\nAssessment: correct\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.\\nStudent Answer: the positive terminal\\nReference Answer: Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 2.\\nStudent Answer: Because they were both on the negative terminal.\\nReference Answer: Terminals 1 and 2 are connected\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why circuit 5 is a short circuit.\\nStudent Answer: path 5 is a short circuit.\\nReference Answer: the battery is contained in a path in which there is no bulb\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and terminal 6.\\n\\nStudent Answer: there is a gap\\n\\nReference Answer: There is a gap between terminals 1 and 6\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to\\x1b[32m produce the assessment. We first need to understand that a voltage reading of 1.5 indicates that the terminals are not connected. The student\\'s answer mentions a gap, which is correct. However, the student\\'s answer does not specify which terminals have the gap between them. Therefore, the student\\'s answer is partially correct and incomplete.\\n\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\x1b[0m\\n\\n\\n'"
